# The Marketing Pod Tech Challenge - attempt 2!

# Challenge Overview

**Time taken:** 5 hours 12mins (4-6 hr guideline)
<br>

**Live site**: https://the-marketing-pod-tech-challenge-vers.netlify.app/
<br>

**Thoughts:** I wasn't happy with my first attempt - not being able to install Tailwind. I was determined to fix that issue over the last couple of days, not run out of time and complete the main objective of the task. Lots to keep learning but overall a complete and better build.
<br>

**Challenges:** Tailwind styling - especially overlaying the modal and forms.  That said the Tailwind cheatsheet came in handy for this: https://flowbite.com/tools/tailwind-cheat-sheet/
<br>

**Features Added:**
Dark mode. Button hover.

**Next steps**
I intend to keep building this dashboard over the next few weeks, add more features (as required) and maybe expand on the idea. Great fun.
